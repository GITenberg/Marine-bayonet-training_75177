<h3>101. GENERAL</h3>

<p>a. <u>Evolution of the Bayonet.</u>—The bayonet is
the infantry weapon which has changed the least
during the development and refinement of weapons
of war during the last three hundred years.
There are several suggested origins of the
bayonet. Some sources suggest that it derives
from the Baioniers, crossbowmen of the middle
ages, who carried a large knife or dagger to
supplement their crossbows. Other sources credit
the smugglers of Basque with using a bayonet-type
weapon as a last ditch defense. Most English
literature sources give the credit to Seigneur
Marecal de Puysegur who, in 1647, at Ypres,
France, ordered his troops to insert their daggers
into the muzzles of their muskets after firing.
De Puysegur and his unit were from Bayonne,
France, a town known for dagger manufacture,
hence the term bayonet.</p>

<p>(1) Early infantry commanders employed a
warrior known as a pikeman, armed with a knife
attached to the end of a quarterstaff, to defend
the musketeers from an enemy charge while the
musket was reloaded. Reloading was a time
consuming operation and the musketeer was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
vulnerable during the time his weapon was
empty. The pikeman stationed himself in front
of the musketeer and warded off any enemy
assault with his pike until the musketeer was
again ready to fire. De Puysegur’s development
thus enabled the musketeer to assume both functions
of the “medieval fire team.” This so called
plug bayonet was used for a period of forty to
fifty years. It consisted of a long dagger with a
tapered shaft which was inserted into the muzzle
of the musket. The taper was necessary since
muzzle diameters were not standardized. The
plug bayonet fitted snugly into the muzzle of the
musket and was difficult to remove. This was
necessary in order to prevent it being withdrawn
by the enemy. The musket could not be fired with
the bayonet inserted, a significant disadvantage.
The plug bayonet lost favor when it contributed
to the defeat of the English at the hands of the
Scots at Killiecrankie, Scotland, in 1689. The
English were ordered to fix bayonets after firing
a volley at the Scots. The British commander then
discovered that his troops were further from the
Scots than he had originally thought. He ordered
bayonets detached and muskets reloaded. Before
loading could be accomplished the Scots closed
with the English and thoroughly routed them.
The English commander, Hugh MacKay, having
noted the disadvantages of the plug bayonet, developed
a modification which came to be known
as the ring bayonet. The ring bayonet was
similar to the plug bayonet, but the tapered shaft
was inserted between two rings fastened to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
muzzle, allowing the musket to be fired with the
bayonet attached. There is some evidence that a
similar device was being used in France ten
years prior to the engagement at Killiecrankie,
indicating that the ring bayonet was not an
English invention.</p>

<p>(2) The ring bayonet still left much to be
desired. The lack of standardization made a
secure fit difficult, and the rings had a tendency
to stretch out of shape with use, rendering the
bayonet useless. This led to the next development
of a new bayonet, known as the socket
bayonet. The socket bayonet was introduced in
the early 1690’s. The lower part of the bayonet
was shaped like an elbow, leaving the blade well
out of the line of fire and seating the bayonet
firmly on the barrel. Again, lack of standardization
made it impossible to produce a single
model which would fit even a small number of
the weapons of one unit. Also, a sudden tug by an
enemy would dislodge the bayonet from the barrel.
These difficulties led to further advancements
in bayonet design, in an attempt to find a rapidly
attachable bayonet which could be held securely
to the barrel. One development made the bayonet
part of the musket itself. This was accomplished
by splitting the socket sleeve of the ring lengthwise
permitting a wider opening which could be
hammered closed to obtain a snug fit. Experiments
with slots, rings, catches, clasps, springs,
and other assorted devices were made in an attempt
to develop a more satisfactory bayonet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>


<p>(3) The bayonet as we know it today has its
origins at the beginning of the 19th century.
Late in the 18th century a major bayonet modification
appeared, the sword bayonet. This has
been the prototype for most bayonets since that
date. The now familiar knife blade bayonet came
into general use about the same time as the
introduction of the magazine rifle, just prior to
the Civil War. There were a variety of shapes
and sizes ranging from the sword-like, 24-inch
blade down to the dagger-type, 10-inch blade.
Typically, there were a variety of short-lived
variations and multiuse bayonets. There were
saw-toothed blades for use by engineer troops,
saber-edged blades for use by the cavalry,
spade-shaped blades to help the infantryman dig
in, and bolo-knife blades for cutting through the
jungles. In addition, there was a ramrod/cleaning
rod blade consisting of a long cleaning rod,
sharpened to a point at one end and folding
under the barrel like the old fashioned cleaning
rod. None of these modifications were adopted
for long. At this point the rifleman had an
instrument with which he could protect himself
as he reloaded his weapon. It served to protect
him and better his morale when rain had soaked
his powder or wind had blown the powder from
his pan. He could now defend himself against the
sabre slashes of the cavalry or a charge by the
infantry.</p>

<p>b. <u>Development of Bayonet Fighting Techniques.</u>—The
bayonet was developed to protect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
the musketeer while he reloaded his weapon, a
defensive mission. The tactics employed were an
individual or unit matter; there was no published
doctrine for bayonet fighting. However, as weapons
improved and rapid fire, longer range weapons
were developed, the troops were more widely
dispersed on the battlefield. The percentage of
time spent in close combat with the enemy was
reduced. As a result, the use of the bayonet, a
close combat weapon, was also reduced. There
is little said about the use of the bayonet in the
American Civil War and Spanish-American War.</p>


<p>(1) The development of the machinegun and
refinements in artillery reversed the trend toward
battlefield mobility and World War I was a static
conflict in which trench warfare was employed.
There were great concentrations of troops,
sometimes in close proximity to one another.
The bayonet was extremely important in trench
fighting, and the experience gained in World
War I led to the publication of the first manuals
on bayonet fighting doctrine. The bayonet was
depicted as an offensive weapon, used in assaulting
enemy troops in trenches. Many of the
principles appearing in these manuals are still
valid today. Early doctrine pictured the bayonet
as essential for successful culmination of the
attack. Artillery fire was capable of demolishing
enemy trenches, but this was undesirable since
the trenches would have to be redug to defend
against the inevitable counterattack. Therefore
the only way to drive the enemy from his trenches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
without destroying the trench and burying him
was through the bayonet assault. The doctrine
set forth in these manuals regarding attitude,
standardization of movements, and practice for
bayonet fighting was as follows:</p>

<p>(a) The bayonet fighter was given a firm
knowledge of the underlying principles of bayonet
combat. The bayonet was regarded as an individual
weapon and each bayonet fighter was
taught in such a manner as to take advantage of
his own physical characteristics. No attempt was
made to set down prescribed standards as to the
position of feet or hands on the weapon. Each
bayonet fighter was left free to choose positions
and movements most natural to him.</p>

<p>(b) Instructors corrected individual errors,
but took advantage of any particular skill possessed
by any individual. Instructors tried to
develop to the fullest degree the proficiency of
the individual, consistent with his physique and
degree of development, but guarded against attempting
to make a precise parade or calisthenic
drill of bayonet training.</p>

<p>(c) Assumption of a vicious, aggressive attitude
was the “spirit of the bayonet.” An actual
bayonet fight was depicted as lasting only a few
seconds during which time the bayonet fighter
was to kill his opponent or be killed himself.
The necessity for aggressive action was as
obvious then as it is today. The enemy was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
be forced on the defensive; the battle was won if
this was achieved. The attack consisted of a
succession of thrusts, cuts, feints, and butt
strokes delivered in succession and without
pause, so as not to allow the opponent to recover.</p>

<p>(d) The employment of teamwork in the
bayonet assault was emphasized. The assaulting
troops remained on line. An individual who got
too far ahead and was killed before assistance
could arrive was not contributing to a successful
assault. Similarly, an individual who remained
behind was useless in the assault.</p>

<p>(2) The individual attack movements described
in early manuals closely resemble those
taught and employed today. Today’s system is
somewhat simpler and facilitates better balance
of the bayonet fighter and control of the weapon.
Training consisted of individual familiarization
with the movements, the use of dummies, thrusting
rings, and practice in assaulting enemy
trenches with troops on line. The latter category
received more emphasis. Dummies were placed
in trenches and attacked by bayonet fighters.
The system of bayonet fighting taught to American
fighting men during World War II closely
resembled that employed during World War I.
The basics of this system were established in
1905 and changed very little through the conduct
of World Wars I and II. Bayonets were employed
during World War I principally in the assault of
enemy trenches, while, in World War II, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
employment was extended to include seizure
of key enemy held terrain objectives.</p>

<p>(3) The bayonet fighting system currently
taught and employed by the Marine Corps was
developed by Doctor Armond H. Seidler, professor
in the Department of Physical Education
at the University of Illinois. Dr. Seidler was a
bayonet instructor in the U.S. Army during World
War II when the Biddle system was taught. He
felt the movements of the old system were
awkward and difficult to execute, and often
caused the bayonet fighter to lose his balance.
If the bayonet fighter failed to disable his opponent
with the first blow he was then frequently
left at the enemy’s mercy. Dr. Seidler was
convinced that the movements of the Biddle
system were unnatural and this would result in
their being discarded in an actual bayonet fight,
and the bayonet fighter resorting to a disorganized
attack on his enemy. Under the Seidler
system the guard position remains the basic
position. All movements begin from the guard
position and each movement consists of an
attack and a recovery. The recovery is a return
to the guard position. In the execution of a
movement, the two phases follow without deliberate
pause. This makes the entire movement a
uniformly smooth action. The attack may be
continued without returning to the guard position,
either by repeating the same movement or
utilizing another followup movement. Followup
movements are designed so that a blocked initial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
movement sets the opponent up for the delivery
of another killing blow without the bayonet fighter
having to return to the guard position and without
loss of balance.</p>

<p>c. <u>The Importance of the Bayonet.</u>—The importance
of the bayonet cannot be measured by
the frequency of its use or the number of casualties
for which it accounts. It is indispensable
because of the confidence it breeds in the individual
fighting man, and the willingness instilled
in him to close with the enemy and destroy him.
Closing with and destroying the enemy is the
mission of the infantry, and the major importance
of the bayonet is that it allows the individual
Marine to accomplish this mission under a wide
variety of conditions. The bayonet is always
loaded and always operative.</p>

<p>(1) The importance of assuming the offense
as a principle of war cannot be questioned. The
bayonet is a symbol of the offense; of aggressiveness.
It gives the infantryman courage and confidence,
provided he is properly trained in its use.
It gives individual infantrymen a more offensive
attitude, and better enables them to accomplish
their mission in the final assault. It gives them a
means of personal protection, contributing to
their security and safety. In addition to its offensive
roles, the bayonet can serve as a last ditch
protective measure.</p>

<p>(2) In situations where friendly and enemy
troops are mingled in hand-to-hand combat, rifle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
fire may hit friendly personnel. However, the
bayonet is more selective and kills only the
person into which it is thrust. As long as the
infantry closes with the enemy this capability
remains important. In situations of reduced visibility
the presence of the bayonet may discourage
premature firing and the tragedy which can
result from it. For a discussion of the employment
of bayonets in the control of riots and civil
disturbances, see FMFM 6-4, <u>Marine Rifle
Company/Platoon</u>.</p>

<p>(3) When stealth is required the bayonet is
irreplaceable. It is flexible, capable of being fixed
to the end of the rifle or held as a knife, silent
and deadly. It gives the riflemen two capacities,
bullets and blade. Bayonet drill is an excellent
physical conditioner. The bayonet assault course
is strenuous exercise and develops a combination
of fitness and skill that contributes to the creation
of total military fitness.</p>


<h3>102. PRINCIPLES OF BAYONET FIGHTING</h3>

<p>The bayonet fighter should be aggressive,
ruthless, savage, and vicious. Herein lies the
key to success with the bayonet. He must never
pause in his attack until he has killed his enemy.
He must follow each vicious attack with another,
remembering that if he does not kill his opponent,
his opponent will kill him. Hesitation, delay, and
excess maneuvering may result in death. The
primary aim of the bayonet fighter is to get his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
blade into the enemy. All defensive moves, butt
strokes, and footwork drive towards this end.
They are actions taken to enable the bayonet
fighter to sink his blade, for it is the blade that
kills. He aims for the vital areas of the enemy.
The throat is the best target, but the belly and
chest are also vulnerable. When the enemy seeks
to protect one vital area, he attacks another. He
hacks, cuts, and slashes the face, arms, and
hands in order to get to the vital areas. He
makes maximum use of the rifle butt to open up
vital areas. He delivers the butt strokes hard and
close in, then kills with the blade. If the opponent
gives no opening, he makes one by parrying his
weapon. If required, the bayonet fighter protects
himself through blocks and parries. The rifle
and bayonet make a good shield. The best defense
is not to allow the opponent to take the
offensive. The successful bayonet fighter strikes
the first blow and follows up with the kill.
Training and practice are the only way to attain
proper form, accuracy, agility, and speed with
the rifle and feet. Practice and training in these
traits lead to coordination, balance, speed, and
endurance. The bayonet fighter must continue to
practice these movements until they become
second nature, and his attack as natural as
running.</p>

MOVEMENTS</h2>
</div>

<h3>201. GENERAL</h3>

<p>a. The basic starting and recovery position in
bayonet fighting is the guard position. From this
position all movements can originate. This includes
movements to attack an enemy, which will
be covered in section 3; movements to change
direction; and movements of the feet. These
movements are natural, instinctive, and easy to
teach and execute. They bear a close resemblance
to the established athletic skill of boxing. Although
the hands are held in a relatively fixed position,
the arm and foot movements, feinting, speed,
and balance are markedly similar. In this system,
the rifle and bayonet are used as a club
or quarterstaff, as well as a spear. There is
no sportsmanship in bayonet fighting. The opponent
must be destroyed, not merely defeated.</p>

<p>b. Descriptions of movements will state approximate
distances. These distances may be
adjusted to suit the individual. All movements
described are for a right-handed bayonet fighter.</p>

<p>c. The rifle and bayonet in the hands of a
trained Marine become a deadly combination of
spear, sword, club, and shield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>


<h3>202. THE GUARD POSITION</h3>

<p>a. <u>General.</u>—As in boxing the basic position
of the bayonet fighter is the GUARD position.
The bayonet fighter in this position is relaxed
and alert. The initial attack movement begins
from this position. Each movement consists of
an attack and a recovery. The recovery is in
fact a return to the guard position. In executing
a movement the phases follow each other without
a deliberate pause, thus making the entire movement
a uniformly smooth action. The attack
may be continued without returning to the guard
position by repeating the same movement or
utilizing another movement. In the guard position
the bayonet fighter is ready to move into the
attack to ward off his enemy. Figures 1 and 2
illustrate front and side views of a bayonet
fighter in the guard position.</p>

<p>b. <u>Position of the Feet.</u>—The feet are spread
apart about shoulder width. The left foot is
about 6 inches forward of the right, in line
with the right instep.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b_015" style="max-width: 27.8125em;">

<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b_016" style="max-width: 27.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_016.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Figure 2.—Guard Position—Side View.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>c. <u>Position of the Body.</u>—The body is held
erect or bent slightly forward from the hips,
if this is more comfortable. The knees are
slightly bent, and the weight is evenly balanced
on the balls of both feet. The right elbow is
slightly forward of the right hip in a relaxed,
natural position and the right forearm is held
approximately parallel to the deck depending on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>the size of the individual. The head is held high
permitting continuous eye contact with the opponent.
The opponent’s facial expression, especially
the eyes, may give the bayonet fighter
warning of his intentions, but the bayonet fighter
must also keep the opponent’s feet and hands
in view through peripheral vision.</p>

<p>d. <u>Position of the Hands.</u>—The hands grip the
rifle firmly, but not tensely. The left hand
grasps the rifle just below the upper sling swivel,
under the sling. The right hand holds the small
of the stock behind the trigger guard.</p>

<p>e. <u>Position of the Rifle.</u>—The rifle is held so
it bisects the angle made by the neck and the
left shoulder. It is held a sufficient distance
from the chest to contribute to the balance of
the bayonet fighter, usually 10 to 15 inches.
The right arm is bent slightly providing a firm,
solid position. The extended position of the arms
protects the bayonet fighter’s body against an
attacker’s blows and permits ready parry movements.
In the guard position the rifle is held
as in port arms, except that the sling and cutting
edge of the blade face the opponent.</p>

<p>f. <u>The Growl.</u>—A yell or growl can be effective
prior to an attack to temporarily stun the
opponent and cause him to freeze momentarily.
This yell or growl should be a short, loud,
vicious noise, executed in much the same manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
as a tiger growls just before he pounces on
his victim. The yell or growl adds a feeling of
aggressiveness, self-confidence, and force to
each attack movement.</p>


<h3>203. CHANGE OF DIRECTION</h3>

<p>a. <u>General.</u>—The whirl is used to face an
opponent not positioned directly to the bayonet
fighter’s front. Whirl movements are executed
by pivoting on the foot of the side to which the
change of direction is to be made. The rifle
and bayonet are held in the guard position during
the execution of the whirl.</p>

<p>b. <u>Execution of the Whirl.</u>—It is possible to
whirl 180° to the right or left, pivoting on the
foot closest to the opponent. It is not necessary
to whirl the entire 180° if stopping short of
that distance permits the bayonet fighter to face
his opponent.</p>


<h3>204. FOOT MOVEMENTS</h3>

<p>a. <u>General.</u>—Proper foot movements must be
utilized in order to enable the bayonet fighter
to maintain balance and maneuverability of his
body at all times, and thus retain the capability
of delivering effective attack movements. The
feet are picked up and set down with a slight
stomp in the shuffle. They are not slid along
the ground. On the battlefield there are numerous
obstacles to trip the bayonet fighter who slides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
his feet. One foot is kept on the deck at all
times. Never bring the feet together as this
results in vulnerability to the slightest attack
or push. The shuffle is used to the front or
either side.</p>

<p>b. <u>Shuffle Right.</u>—To shuffle right, step to the
right about 15 inches with the right foot, and
follow with the left foot. To move to the right
front, execute a partial whirl to the right and
then shuffle forward in the desired direction.
Figure 3 illustrates steps involved in the shuffle
right movement.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Figure 3.—Shuffle Right.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>c. <u>Shuffle Left.</u>—To shuffle left, follow the
same procedure for shuffle right, except move
the left foot to the left and follow with the right.
To move to the left front execute a partial whirl
to the left and then shuffle forward in the desired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
direction. See figure <a href="#i_b_020">4</a> for an illustration

position. See figure <a href="#i_b_021">5</a> for an illustration of the
shuffle forward.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SECTION_3_INDIVIDUAL_ATTACK">SECTION 3: INDIVIDUAL ATTACK</h2>
</div>


<h3>301. GENERAL</h3>

<p>There are five basic attack movements; the
slash (to include the horizontal slash), vertical
butt stroke, smash, horizontal butt stroke, and
jab. The movements described for hands, feet,
and body are done simultaneously, both in the
attack and during recovery to the guard position.</p>


<h3>302. THE SLASH</h3>

<p>a. <u>Execution.</u>—The slash is executed in the
following manner:</p>

<p>(1) Assume the guard position.</p>

<p>(2) Step forward about 15 inches with the
left foot, keeping the right foot in place as a base.
(See fig. <a href="#i_b_024">6</a>.)</p>

<p>(3) Hold the right hand in place, extending
the left arm almost fully, while pulling back on
the butt with the right arm. Swing the edge of
the bayonet forward and down in a slashing arc
aimed at the opponent’s neck area.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b_024" style="max-width: 36.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_024.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Figure 6.—Slash-Step Forward.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<br>

<p>(4) The step forward and the extension of the
left arm are performed simultaneously. The
forward step adds force to the slashing movement.</p>

<p>(5) At full extension of the arms, when delivery
of the blow is complete, the bayonet should
be flat. The left arm is extended, and the right
forearm is held along the stock of the rifle,
approximately waist high. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_032">7</a>.)</p>

<p>b. <u>Horizontal Slash.</u>—There is a variation
to this movement known as the horizontal slash.
The difference is that the bayonet fighter steps
forward with the left foot and rotates his body
to the right by pivoting on the right foot. At the
same time bring the rifle and bayonet to a relatively
horizontal position in front of the body.
Simultaneously, the right arm is pulled across
the body and a hooking action is executed with
the left arm. This slash is directed on a horizontal
plane at the opponent’s head, neck or side.</p>

<p>c. <u>Recovery to the Guard Position</u></p>

<p>(1) Bend the left arm, pivoting the rifle in
the right hand.</p>

<p>(2) Take a step forward with the right foot.</p>

<p>(3) Rotate the body slightly to the front.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>


<h3>303. THE VERTICAL BUTT STROKE</h3>

<p>a. <u>Execution.</u>—The vertical butt stroke is executed
in the following manner:</p>

<p>(1) Assume the guard position.</p>

<p>(2) Step forward with the right foot about 15
inches. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_028">8</a>.)</p>

<p>(3) Using the left hand as a pivot for the
rifle, drive the right hand forward and upward in
an uppercut type motion. Aim the butt of the rifle
at the groin. If the opponent bends to avoid being
hit in the groin, his midsection and chin will
protrude. In this event, carry the stroke upward
until contact is made with his midsection or chin
along the centerline of his body.</p>

<p>(4) Execute the step and uppercut motion at
the same time to add force to the blow. (See
figs. <a href="#i_b_029">9</a> and <a href="#i_b_030">10</a>.)</p>

<p>b. <u>Recovery to the Guard Position.</u></p>

<p>(1) Pull the right hand back and down until
the right elbow is again slightly forward of the
right hip in a relaxed, natural position.</p>

<p>(2) Step forward with the left foot and assume
the guard position.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>


<h3>304. THE SMASH</h3>

<p>a. <u>Execution.</u>—The smash, frequently used as
a followup to the vertical or horizontal butt
stroke, is executed as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Assume the guard position.</p>

<p>(2) Draw the left arm back to the neck area.
The rifle is held with sling up. The rifle is now
over the left shoulder, parallel to the deck.
(See fig. <a href="#i_b_032">11</a>.)</p>

<p>(3) Step toward the opponent about 15 inches
with the right foot, slamming the rifle butt
into the opponent’s face by extending the
arms about 6 inches toward the target, the
rifle remains parallel to the deck. (See fig.
<a href="#i_b_033">12</a>.)</p>

<p>(4) Follow with the left foot after the
blow has been struck. If further extension
of the arms is necessary, the bayonet fighter
should shuffle forward and again execute the
smash.</p>

<p>b. <u>Recovery to the Guard Position.</u>—Step forward
with the left foot about 15 inches, assuming
the guard position.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>


<h3>305. THE HORIZONTAL BUTT STROKE</h3>

<p>a. <u>Execution.</u>—The horizontal butt stroke is
executed as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Assume the guard position.</p>

<p>(2) Step forward approximately 20 inches
forward with the right foot, using the left foot as
a pivot point. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_035">13</a>.)</p>

<p>(3) Simultaneously, bring the rifle butt across
in a horizontal arc, using the left hand as a pivot
point. The right arm is almost completely extended.
This is a fast hooking action.</p>

<p>(4) During delivery the rifle is held flat on
its side so the toe of the rifle and the sling are
pointed toward the target. If the rifle is not held
flat, it is possible that the stock will be broken
by the force of an aggressive butt stroke. (See
figs. <a href="#i_b_036">14</a> and <a href="#i_b_037">15</a>.)</p>

<p>(5) Aim the toe of the butt plate at the opponent’s
head, neck, or side.</p>

<p>(6) The step, pivot, and blow should all occur
simultaneously in order to add force to the blow.</p>

<p>b. <u>Recovery to the Guard Position.</u></p>

<p>(1) Step forward with the left foot.</p>

<p>(2) Bend the right arm, lowering the right
hand to assume the guard position.</p>
<br>

<h3>306. THE JAB</h3>

<p>a. <u>Execution.</u>—The jab is executed as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Assume the guard position.</p>

<p>(2) Move the left hand downward diagonally
across the body, extending the left arm fully. At
this point the blade of the bayonet should be flat,
pointed toward the opponent. At the same time,
pull the small of the stock to the rear with the
right hand until the cone of the stock is opposite
the hip bone and the right forearm is resting
along the flat of the stock with the sling turned
out. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_039">16</a>.)</p>

<p>(3) Aim the blade at the opponents midsection
from the stomach to the throat.</p>

</div>


<h3>401. GENERAL</h3>

<p>At times the bayonet fighter may lose the
initiative and the opponent may move into the
attack. Some defensive measures are therefore
necessary for protection and in order to permit
the bayonet fighter to regain the initiative. The
basic defensive moves are the block and parry.
The parry is effective against the jab, while
the block is used against the slash and the
vertical butt stroke. Timing, speed, and judgment
are key factors in handling defensive
moves. The parry is done either to the right or
left, depending on the position of the incoming
blade. If the opponent’s blade comes in above
the bayonet fighter’s piece, the parry should be
to the right. If it comes in below the bayonet
fighter’s piece, the parry should be to the left.</p>


<h3>402. PARRY RIGHT</h3>

<p>a. <u>Execution</u></p>

<p>(1) If the opponent’s blade is thrust toward
the bayonet fighter in a position above the piece
of the bayonet fighter, the parry will be to the
right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>(2) From the guard position, step forward
about 7 inches with the left foot, keeping the
right foot as a base.</p>

<p>(3) Extend the left arm outward, to the right
and down, engaging the opponent’s weapon and
forcing it to the right and down. This is done by
pulling the right hand back along the right hip.
Ideally, the opponent’s weapon is engaged at the
balance of the bayonet fighter’s weapon. The
operating handle is pointed toward the deck after
the opponent’s weapon is engaged. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_045">19</a>.)</p>

<p>b. <u>Move into the Attack and Recovery.</u></p>

<p>(1) Move directly into the attack rather than
returning to the guard position.</p>

<p>(2) Deliver a jab, or step forward with the
right foot and deliver a vertical butt stroke.</p>

<p>(3) Recover to the guard position as prescribed
in section 3.</p>


<h3>403. PARRY LEFT</h3>

<p>a. <u>Execution.</u></p>

<p>(1) If the opponent’s blade is thrust toward
the bayonet fighter in a position below the piece
of the bayonet fighter, the parry will be to the
left.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>(2) From the guard position, step forward
about 7 inches with the left foot, using the right
foot as a base. Bring the rifle to a vertical position
with the right forearm nearly parallel to
the deck.</p>

<p>(3) Snap the left hand forward to the left and
down engaging the opponent’s weapon anywhere
between the back of the bayonet and the balance
of the bayonet fighter’s piece. The rifle will be
nearly horizontal with the operating handle up
and the sling pointing toward the opponent. (See
fig. <a href="#i_b_047">20</a>.)</p>

<p>b. <u>Move into the Attack and Recovery.</u></p>

<p>(1) After the parry left, a slash can be delivered
by stepping forward with the left foot.
A horizontal or vertical butt stroke can be delivered
by stepping forward with the right foot.</p>

<p>(2) Recover to the guard position as prescribed
in section 3.</p>


<h3>404. BLOCK AGAINST SLASH</h3>

<p>a. <u>Execution.</u></p>

<p>(1) From the guard position, thrust the rifle
out and up. The weapon stays in the same general
position as in the guard position, but the arms
are now nearly at full extension.</p>

<p>(2) Push the balance of the rifle into the opponent’s
rifle. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_055">21</a>.)</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>b. <u>Move Into the Attack and Recovery.</u></p>

<p>(1) After the opponent’s slash is blocked he
is overextended and off balance.</p>

<p>(2) Counter with a slash or horizontal butt
stroke.</p>

<p>(3) Recover to the guard position in the same
manner as outlined in section 3.</p>


<h3>405. BLOCK AGAINST VERTICAL BUTT STROKE</h3>

<p>a. <u>Execution</u></p>

<p>(1) From the guard position, extend the arms
out and down.</p>

<p>(2) The rifle is now nearly horizontal to the
deck, and the arms fully extended.</p>

<p>(3) Engage the opponent’s stock near the
balance of the rifle. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_050">22</a>.)</p>

<p>b. <u>Move into the Attack and Recovery</u></p>

<p>(1) Counter with a horizontal slash or
horizontal butt stroke.</p>

<p>(2) Recover to the guard position in the same
manner prescribed in section 3.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SECTION_5_COMBINATION">SECTION 5: COMBINATION
MOVEMENTS</h2>
</div>


<h3>501. GENERAL</h3>

<p>Followup movements are attack movements
which naturally and harmoniously follow other
attack movements. The followup movement is
executed from the completed position of the
previous movement, rather than after recovery
to the guard position. To ensure a successful
attack a bayonet fighter follows each movement
with another attack movement until he has killed
his opponent. All attack movements are designed
so that the attacker is in position to deliver
another attack movement should his initial attack
not be successful. For example, if the attacker
delivers a slash which is blocked, he is in excellent
position to followup with a vertical butt
stroke. Ideally, the followup movement is executed
in the same plane as the previous movement,
and it is in keeping with this principle that
the followup movements listed in the following
paragraph are designed. The most important
principle is to follow the initial attack with
another offensive action so that the initiative is
not lost. The key principle here is aggressiveness
rather than a memorized technique. Aggressiveness
is the real spirit of the followup attack.
Show no mercy, for the enemy will show none.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>


<h3>502. LIST OF MOVEMENTS</h3>

<p>The below listed combinations allow the best
transition from one attack movement to another
with the least amount of wasted motion. This
enables the bayonet fighter to stay on the attack
without having to return to the guard position
after an unsuccessful initial attack, thus risking
loss of the initiative.</p>

<p>a. Guard, slash, vertical butt stroke or horizontal
butt stroke, recover to guard position.</p>

<p>b. Guard, parry left, vertical butt stroke or
horizontal butt stroke, smash, slash, recover to
guard position.</p>

<p>c. Guard, jab, vertical butt stroke, smash,
slash, recover to guard position.</p>

<p>d. Guard, parry right, jab, recover to guard
position.</p>

<p>e. Guard, block slash, vertical butt stroke,
smash, recover to guard position.</p>

<p>f. Guard, block vertical butt stroke, slash or
jab, horizontal butt stroke, recover to guard
position.</p>

<p>g. Guard, block vertical butt stroke, horizontal
slash, vertical butt stroke, smash, recover to
guard position.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SECTION_6_GROUP_ATTACK_AND">SECTION 6: GROUP ATTACK AND
DEFENSE</h2>
</div>


<h3>601. GENERAL</h3>

<p>a. All the individuals in group actions employ
the same individual movements previously described.</p>

<p>b. Teamwork is important in any endeavor, and
especially in fighting. The bayonet fighting team
can use a few simple tactics to take advantage of
superior numbers before the enemy reinforces
his position. Teamwork can also be used to overcome
a numerical advantage favoring the enemy.</p>


<h3>602. GROUP ATTACK</h3>

<p>a. <u>Two Against One.</u>—Two Marines approach
a single enemy. Unable to anticipate his actions
they advance directly forward but neither converges
on him. As the range closes, the enemy
will turn his attention toward one of the two. This
Marine advances quickly toward the enemy and
engages him. The other Marine advances quickly
toward the enemy’s exposed flank and kills him.
Should the enemy turn to guard his exposed
flank he exposes the other flank, and can be
killed by the Marine who first attacked him. In
such a coordinated attack the Marine who makes
the kill is usually the one attacking the exposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
flank. The approach, attack, and kill are made
in a very few seconds. The importance of speed
and aggressive action is obvious. (See fig.
<a href="#i_b_055">23</a>.)</p>

<p>b. <u>Three Against Two.</u>—Three Marines approach
two opponents. The Marines advance
directly forward awaiting the enemy’s reaction.
Two Marines will be engaged. The third then
moves swiftly to the exposed flank of one of
the enemy, usually the nearest to his position.
As soon as one enemy is killed, the
other is attacked swiftly from his exposed
flank by the Marine who can reach him first.
Should either enemy being attacked on the exposed
flank turn to defend that flank, he is
swiftly killed by the Marine who was originally
making the frontal attack. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_056">24</a>).</p>


<h3>603. GROUP DEFENSE</h3>

<p>a. <u>One Against Two.</u>—When one Marine is
engaged by two enemy opponents, he immediately
dashes to the outboard flank of the nearest
enemy. Should he allow himself to be caught
between the two, he will be easily killed. He
always keeps an enemy between himself and the
other enemy so they can be engaged and killed
one at a time. A savage attack and quick disposal
of one enemy, before the second can move to the
aid of the first, turns the tide. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_057">25</a>.)</p>

<p>b. <u>Two Against Three.</u>—When two Marines are
engaged by three enemy, both move to the outboard
flanks of the enemy, leaving one enemy in the middle.
Each Marine savagely attacks and disposes of
his adversary before the enemy in the middle can
act to help one of his companions. Once one Marine
has defeated his opponent he turns on the lone
enemy in the middle. Again, victory will go the side
which acts swiftly and aggressively. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_058">26</a>.)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SECTION_7_TRAINING">SECTION 7: TRAINING</h2>
</div>


<h3>701. GENERAL</h3>

<p>a. In addition to introducing the student to the
offensive and defensive movements of bayonet
fighting, the initial stages of training should
emphasize the development of speed, form, balance,
timing, coordination, and a vicious, aggressive
attitude, all important in bayonet fighting.
The instructor works to develop a genuine determination
in his students; i.e., to gain the
initiative from the beginning and move in to kill
the opponent. Each student yells and growls as
he executes his practice moves to get into the
proper habit. This gives the student the self-confidence
and enthusiasm he needs. The instructor
tries to make the yell spontaneous, if
possible, but if students fail to perform properly,
they are encouraged until they do so.</p>

<p>b. Future training rekindles the spirit of aggressiveness.
Variety is employed in training to
avoid boredom and useless repetition. The use
of training aids such as the pugil stick and bayonet
assault course provide this variety, and are
also extremely valuable as training vehicles.
Bayonet training should be as vigorous as possible
in order to contribute to the physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
condition of the student. It should be emphasized
that bayonet fighting is not for the soft and
paunchy.</p>


<h3>702. DEMONSTRATION AND APPLICATION OF
THE BASIC FUNDAMENTALS</h3>

<p>a. The recommended sequence for demonstration
and application of the basic fundamentals of
bayonet fighting is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Guard position and footwork.</p>

<p>(2) Attack movements.</p>

<p>(3) Defensive movements.</p>

<p>(4) Combined movements.</p>

<p>(5) Group attack and defense.</p>
</div>

<p>b. Each position and movement is explained in
detail and demonstrated by the primary instructor.
Fundamentals and footwork, as well as
attack and defensive movements, are covered
slowly and thoroughly.</p>

<p>c. After a thorough explanation and demonstration,
the students move slowly through everything
covered in subparagraph a, above, in slow
motion, by the numbers, until they are thoroughly
familiar with what they have been taught. Speed
is increased as the students become more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
familiar with the movements until they are being
conducted at full speed. Timing, enthusiasm, and
an aggressive spirit are maintained.</p>

<p>d. The whole sequence should be completed for
one group of movements before the next is taught.
For example, the student should be thoroughly
familiar with the positions and footwork, and
have mastered them at the normal rate, before
he is introduced to the attack movements.</p>

<p>e. After individual movements have been
mastered, combinations and followup movements
are taught. These movements are then practiced
by the students until they become second nature.
The most effective movement to follow another
is influenced by the opponent’s reaction. These
movements are stressed and practiced until they
become automatic. The bayonet fighter cannot stop
to consider his next move. It is necessary that
the student be able to deliver a forceful, aggressive
series of attack movements, accompanied
by proper footwork, without hesitation or indecision.</p>

<p>f. Practice of the attack and defensive movements
against another student at half speed
facilitates correction of errors. The two students
correct one another, and secondary instructors
move among the students, assisting with corrections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>g. Throughout training the student should be
relaxed to avoid rigidity. The weapons should be
held firmly, but not tensely. All phases of bayonet
fighting are practiced until they are executed
instinctively. The student should be able to strike
at openings without thinking, and remain in the
attack until he has killed his opponent.</p>


<h3>703. THE ASSAULT COURSE</h3>

<p>a. <u>Purpose.</u>—The bayonet assault course is
constructed in order to achieve the following
objectives:</p>

<p>(1) To familiarize the student with situations
simulating those with which he might be confronted
in an actual combat situation.</p>

<p>(2) To aid in developing the student’s speed,
strength, and endurance.</p>

<p>(3) To challenge the determination and will
power of the student. These qualities are extremely
important.</p>

<p>(4) To provide a means for obtaining good
bayonet fighting habits.</p>

<p>(5) To develop skill in bayonet fighting and
make the various movements instinctive and
second nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>b. <u>Obstacles.</u>—The model assault course presented
in this publication consists of ten obstacles.
They are offered as examples of what
can be used. The number and type of obstacles
included in any given course depend on the ingenuity
of the builders and local conditions. These
obstacles are attacked with a mockup rifle which
should resemble the M-14 rifle in weight and
dimensions.</p>

<p>(1) Obstacle number 1 represents an enemy
in the guard position. The student executes a
parry right, steps forward, and executes a jab.
(See fig. <a href="#i_b_063">27</a>.)</p>
<br>

vertical butt stroke. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_066-1">30</a>.)</p>

<p>(5) Obstacle number 5 represents an opponent
running toward the bayonet fighter. The
student executes a jab so that the blade penetrates
the center of the obstacle. The instructor
emphasizes the importance of withdrawing the
blade before moving on. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_066-2">31</a>.)</p>

<p>(9) Obstacle number 9 represents an enemy
behind an embankment. The student charges
over the embankment, turns to face the enemy,
executes a jab, then withdraws. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_069-2">35</a>.)</p>

<p>(10) Obstacle number 10 is a training aid
which can be used in connection with either
basic or advanced bayonet drill. It is inexpensive
and versatile. The trainee has his choice of
methods of attack and can utilize all accepted
bayonet movements against this obstacle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>It can be used to introduce a “free” movement
within an established course, depending on the
individuals speed or position, or to constitute
an entire course, utilizing assistant instructors
to call different methods of attack in order to
vary the trainees approach to the aid. (See
fig. <a href="#i_b_071">36</a>.)</p>

<br>

<p>c. <u>Construction.</u>—The ten obstacles are constructed
from readily available materials. They
consist mostly of old auto tires, canvas, and
2 by 4 inches and 4 by 4 inches lumber. Obstacles
1, 2, and 10 have moving wooden arms which
are not difficult to construct. The obstacles
should be set far enough apart to allow maneuvering
between them. The assault course can be
laid out in any available terrain, and should be
at least 200 to 300 meters in length. Rugged
terrain provides excellent physical conditioning
facilities. Natural obstacles such as streams,
ridges, thick foliage, etc., can be used to make
the course more difficult. Artificial obstacles
such as wire entanglements, log walks, hurdles,
and fences can also be added.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Figure 36.—Obstacle 10 (Combination Obstacle).</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>d. <u>Safety Precautions.</u>—Students should first
run the assault course at a moderate pace, and
increase their speed as their technique and
physical condition improve. The instructor ensures
that discipline and control are maintained.
The instructor and his assistants station themselves
along the course to observe the method of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>attack and make necessary corrections. In addition,
the following safety precautions should be
observed:</p>

<p>(1) Ensure that the bayonet is securely attached
to the weapon before beginning the assault
course.</p>

<p>(2) Caution personnel to remain in the line
of obstacles. Serious injury can result if personnel
are permitted to zigzag through the
course.</p>

<p>(3) Do not permit personnel to attack the
first obstacle until preceding personnel have
reached the third obstacle.</p>

<p>(4) When the last obstacle is completed,
personnel should be directed to return by specific
routes to the designated marshalling area,
remaining at least 5 yards away from the closest
obstacle.</p>

<p>e. <u>Demonstration and Application.</u>—The first
phase of the assault course training includes a
demonstration of the technique of attacking each
obstacle by the instructor. The instructor then
runs the entire course employing the correct
movements on each obstacle. The students then
practice their movements on the individual obstacles.
When the students have gained sufficient
proficiency they move through the entire assault
course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>


<h3>704. THE PUGIL STICK</h3>

<p>a. <u>General.</u>—The execution of the movements
of bayonet fighting in response to a verbal command
from instructors are kept to a minimum.
This type of training is necessary to teach the
movements, but once they have been learned the
student must automatically execute them in response
to the movements of his opponent. There
is no substitute for practical application when
learning a skill. Actual bayonet fighting is not
practical because of the hazards involved. However,
bouts employing the pugil stick bear a close
resemblance to actual bayonet fights, and can be
employed without serious injury to either contestant.
The student sees for himself the importance
of assuming the attack immediately, as
well as the importance of aggressiveness and
ferocity. He sees which combinations of blows
are successful, and learns to understand the result
of his making a mistake in an actual bayonet
fight. Here he learns the meaning of the term
“kill or be killed.”</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b_074" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b_074.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">Figure 37.—The Pugil Stick Material.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>b. <u>Construction.</u>—See figure <a href="#i_b_074">37</a>.</p>

<p>(1) Materials for construction of the pugil
stick include the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(a) An octagonal stick 1¾ inches in diameter
and 44 inches long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>(b) Two canvas bags 10 inches long, one
6 inches in diameter and one 8 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>(c) Chopped foam rubber and cotton padding.</p>

<p>(d) A roll of foam rubber 15 inches wide.</p>

<p>(e) Tape, wire, and tacks.</p>
</div>

<p>(2) <u>Method of Construction.</u></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(a) Cut grooves ½-inch deep in the stick
as shown in the diagram (see fig. <a href="#i_b_074">37</a>). Taper the
stick at the hand grips to approximately 1¼
inches in diameter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>(b) Fill the bags with chopped foam rubber
and cotton.</p>

<p>(c) Wire and tack the bags to the end of
the stick. Tighten the wire into the grooves at
the end of the stick. The stick should extend
6 inches into the bag, leaving 4 inches of overlap
and making the total length of the pugil stick
52 inches, the length of the M-14 rifle with
bayonet.</p>

<p>(d) Cover the wire and tacks with tape.</p>

<p>(e) Wrap foam rubber around the center
of the stick, leaving only the 6 to 8 inches of
tapered hand grip exposed. Secure the foam
rubber padding with tape.</p>
</div>

<p>(3) <u>Size of Pugil Stick.</u>—The pugil stick
should be approximately the same length and
weight as the M-14 rifle with bayonet attached.
This enables the bayonet fighter to train with a
weapon which closely approximates the weapon
he uses in an actual combat situation.</p>

<p>c. <u>Safety Equipment and Precautions</u></p>

<p>(1) Whenever engaged in a pugil stick bout,
the student should be equipped with the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(a) A football helmet with full bird cage
face mask.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>(b) Lacrosse gloves.</p>

<p>(c) Protective cup athletic supporter.</p>
</div>

<p>(2) Instructors in charge of pugil stick bouts
see that proper bayonet fighting procedures are
followed by students engaged in bouts. The proper
bayonet fighting grip is employed at all times.
The pugil stick is not used as a baseball bat.
In no instance do the hands leave the pugil stick.
Neither throwing or swinging is allowed. Pugil
stick fighters refrain from hitting their opponent
with the center portion of the pugil stick.</p>

<p>(3) Instructors ensure that protective equipment
is properly secured before the bout begins.
Bouts will be stopped whenever one participant
becomes completely defenseless, after a telling
blow has been struck, when equipment becomes
loosened or knocked off, or when the pugil stick
is being used improperly. Students are instructed
to stop all action when the whistle is blown.</p>

<p>d. <u>Regulations for Bouts</u></p>

<p>(1) Students are normally paired off so that
opponents are of approximately equal height and
weight.</p>

<p>(2) Each bout is officiated by an instructor
with a whistle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>(3) Contests continue until one contestant has
scored a killing blow. A killing blow is one delivered
solidly to the head, neck, groin, or midsection
with the blade end of the pugil stick; and
to the head, groin, or neck with the butt end of
the stick. If a killing blow is struck in the first
few seconds of the bout, for training purposes
the bout may be continued for a prescribed
period of time. The winner will be the individual
who struck the most killing blows in the time
allotted. Time limits may be set by the instructor,
taking into consideration the physical condition
of the students and the time available.</p>

<p>(4) Instructors periodically remind students
that basic attack movements and combinations
are most effective. Instructors also continually
emphasize aggressiveness. They ensure that all
trainees yell and growl while engaged in a bout.</p>

<p>(5) Short bouts, with rapid changing of equipment,
retains enthusiasm and interest.</p>

<p>(6) Bouts begin with both contestants in the
guard position and about 5 yards apart. (See
figs. <a href="#i_b_078">38</a> and <a href="#i_b_079">39</a>.)</p>

<p>(7) No score occurs if a student removes
either hand from the weapon to throw or swing
at his opponent. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_080">40</a>.)</p>
<br>

<p>(8) A round-robin type elimination is effective
in getting all students into bouts, and emphasizing
the importance of aggressive action in
winning. The winners of each bout are allowed
to fight again after a brief rest, until they are
defeated. This provides one winner in the end,
with appropriate personal recognition.</p>

<p>e. <u>Demonstration and Application.</u>—All movements,
offensive, defensive, and combinations are
demonstrated with the pugil stick. The student
is then given the opportunity to go through the
movements with the pugil stick in slow motion,
and then at normal speed. After gaining proficiency
in all movements the students are given
an opportunity to practice what they have learned
against a target. An artificial stationary target
offering resistance further develops timing and
coordination. Heavy bags, similar to the type
used by boxers in training, can be used effectively
to train bayonet fighters. (See fig. <a href="#i_b_082">41</a>.)
After the student has attacked the dummies,
allowing him the sensation of attacking a solid
target, and practicing the attack movements, he
is then ready for bouts against other students.</p>
